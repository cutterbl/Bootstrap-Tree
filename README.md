Bootstrap Tree v0.4
==============

A lightweight Tree component, built for use with the Twitter Bootstrap framework.

A work in progress. All feedback is welcome.

[11.22.2013] - v0.4 - Ground up rewrite of entire project, slimming down base interface requirements,
adjusting event bindings, expanding the use of the data api. Currently only supports pulling json, 
but that will change
